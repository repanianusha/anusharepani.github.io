            Mahatma Gandhi Biography 
Mahatma Gandhi, also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, a coastal town in present-day Gujarat, India. His birth marked the beginning of a life that would later be revered as the guiding light of India’s struggle for independence from British colonial rule. Gandhi’s teachings of nonviolence, civil disobedience, and self-reliance earned him the title of “Mahatma,” meaning “great soul,” and made him a symbol of peace and unity worldwide.        
</p>
<p>
    Gandhi was born into a devout Hindu family. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, was a respected diwan (chief minister) of the Porbandar state, while his mother, Putlibai, was a deeply religious and compassionate woman. From a young age, Gandhi imbibed his parents’ values of honesty, compassion, and humility.

Gandhi received his early education in Porbandar, where he demonstrated an insatiable curiosity and love for learning. At the age of nine, he moved to Rajkot to attend the local school. Despite his inherent shyness, Gandhi proved to be an intelligent and disciplined student.

In 1888, at the age of 18, Gandhi left for London to study law. He attended University College London and later the Inner Temple to become a barrister. During his time in London, he embraced vegetarianism, a decision that would become an integral part of his life.
</p>
<p>
    Mahatma Gandhi is known as the “Father of the Nation .” He was the leader of the Indian independence movement. He carried out a nationwide campaign after his return to India in 1915, where he learned about the issues Indians were facing. Therefore, he organised and led three significant movements: the Ahmedabad mill strike in 1918, the Kheda Satyagraha in 1918, and the Champaran Satyagraha in 1917. He founded the Satyagraha Sabha in 1919 in opposition to the Rowlatt Act, which he called the "Black Act." He began the Non-Cooperation movement in 1920 to win Purna Swaraj and self-rule. In 1930, he organised the Salt Satyagraha, popularly known as the Dandi March, to protest against the salt law. He started the Quit India Movement in 1942 at the All India Congress Committee meeting in Mumbai after the defeat of the Cripps Mission.

        Jawaharlal Nehru: As the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru played a crucial role in shaping the nation’s destiny after independence. He was a pre-eminent fighter and a key leader in the freedom movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the top 10 freedom fighters of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru was born on November 14, 1889, in Prayagraj, where he earned the endearing nickname “Chacha Nehru.” His fervor for independence was greatly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi’s endeavors to free India from the British. Starting as a lawyer, Nehru rose to prominence as a politician and advocate for Indian independence. He actively participated in the war for freedom and eventually became the President of the Indian National Congress. When India achieved independence, he was appointed as the country’s first Prime Minister. His affection for children led to the celebration of his birthday as Children’s Day.
